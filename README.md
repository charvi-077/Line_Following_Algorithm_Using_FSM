# Line_Following_Algorithm_Using_FSM

As we are all know that there there are lots of Complex Line Following Algorithms and considering all the complexity espically using PID with less no of IR sensors , its become quite difficult to implement . So here is the code of Line Following Algorithm using Finite State Machines ,which is an easiest and effecient alternative to implement on real bots.

This is contributred work . For Further details you can check :http://bit.ly/fsm_poster
